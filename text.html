 here is some notes I toke based on the youtube page code:
<ytd-playlist-panel-renderer
  id="playlist"
  class="style-scope ytd-watch-flexy"
  hidden
>
  <div id="container" class="style-scope ytd-playlist-panel-renderer"></div
></ytd-playlist-panel-renderer>

inside the playlist element we have a container div that contains 3  elements,
  the first contains the play list header (name, number of videos, clear button ...)
  the the items one contain the videos of the play list

<div id="container">
  <div class="header style-scope ytd-playlist-panel-renderer"></div>
  <div id="content-header"></div>
  <div id="items"></div>
</div>


  inside the 'items' div, each video is presented on the element 'ytd-playlist-panel-video-renderer'

<div id="items">
  <ytd-playlist-panel-video-renderer
    id="playlist-items"
    class="style-scope ytd-playlist-panel-renderer"
  ></ytd-playlist-panel-video-renderer>
  <ytd-playlist-panel-video-renderer
    id="playlist-items"
    class="style-scope ytd-playlist-panel-renderer"
  ></ytd-playlist-panel-video-renderer>
</div>

in side each video element there is the 'badge-shape' element that conains the duration of the video,
    not a direct child of the 'badge-shape' but nested on a lot other elements
<badge-shape
  class="badge-shape-wiz badge-shape-wiz--default badge-shape-wiz--overlay badge-shape-wiz--thumbnail-badge"
  aria-label="19 minutes, 2 seconds"
>
  <div class="badge-shape-wiz__text">19:02</div>
</badge-shape>

the second important element is the element that shows how much of the video has been watched,
  is on the element 'ytd-thumbnail-overlay-resume-playback-renderer' and it contains a div with a width style in percentage,
  that percentage is the amount watched on the video

<ytd-thumbnail-overlay-resume-playback-renderer>
  <div id="progress" style="width: 10%;"></div>
</ytd-thumbnail-overlay-resume-playback-renderer>

I think this is all I need, now I want to count the total duration of the whole playlist and show how much have been watched
    and how much rest on a new div element that show appear on the header element

    <div id="secondary">
      <div id="secondary-inner">
        <div id="panels">
            <ytd-playlist-panel-renderer>
              
            </ytd-playlist-panel-renderer>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
